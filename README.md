# primeiro-site

This is the first website I build in the HTML5 + CSS course of CursoEmVideo.
The core idea is to build a news website but with only "one news"LOL.
ALL THE CONTENT WAS PROVIDED BY GUSTAVO GUANABARA (AMAZING TEACHER, TY FOR ALL).
My only work here is the code itself, in general made all alone.
I hope you enjoy and please give me some advices.
Sorry for the poor english.
